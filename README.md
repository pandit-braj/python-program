I am adding three projects to this repository, which are games created using Python.

Hangman Game: A word-guessing game where players try to guess a hidden word by suggesting letters. Incorrect guesses lead to a progressively drawn figure, and the game ends when either the word is guessed or the figure is fully drawn.

Rock, Paper, Scissors: A classic hand game where players choose between rock, paper, or scissors. The game follows the rules: rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock. The winner is determined based on the choices made.

Tic-Tac-Toe: A simple two-player game where players take turns marking Xs or Os on a 3x3 grid. The goal is to be the first to get three of your marks in a row, column, or diagonal.
